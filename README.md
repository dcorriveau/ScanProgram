ScanProgram
===========

A WIA based Scanning program that is also capable of editing images, and saving encoded messages.

This application is used to show off the usage of WIA in image applications. It also shows the usage of image I/O in a .NET environment, and encryption through the use of bitmaps.

The application will only work with bitmap images for saving/loading.

A doxygen build has also been added to provide more levels of documentation in the application.
